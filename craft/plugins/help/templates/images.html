#Images
Images should be saved as .jpg – please do not attempt to upload .tiff files!

##Image sizes
Please make sure you size images correctly, as images which are too large will not upload or might break the website! (As a general rule, keep the file size to around 5mb or less.)

Don’t worry about re-sizing images for tablet or mobile – that’s done for you automatically.
