#Administration


##Managing Users
Control what your administrators see in the control panel

###How permissions work
Users’ access can be granted on a ‘per section’ basis (note; that is sections and not pages), and can be limited to:

* Edit existing entries
* Create new
* Publish live
* Edit other people’s entries
     ** Delete other people’s entries
     ** Publish other people’s drafts
     ** Delete other people’s drafts
* Delete entries

Along with sections, there is also some key functionality certain users may need access to:

* Form-builder
* Settings (Globals)
* Manage users and their permissions
* The file manager (Assets)

###Member groups
Given the number of sections, setting permissions for individual members can get messy; however we can put them into groups.

Member groups are essentially a preset for the permissions checklist. Extra privileges can be unlocked on a per-user basis (however you cannot lock things that are open to a group if a member is part of that group), and a member can be attached to one or more groups. Multiple groups will combine all of the privileges from each group.

Groups should really be a collection of ‘content types’ that particular sets of users are likely to all need access to.
