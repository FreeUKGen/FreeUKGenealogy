#Style Guide

<header>
<p>This guide aims to keep the site’s presentation style consistent across pages. This guide is aimed particularly at new administrators to the site. Please take the time to read through the lists below, and ensure best practise with all types of content.
</p>
</header>


##General Practices

   * Don’t add a double space at the end of sentences. (This isn’t a press release!)
   * Paragraphs should be a maximum of 8 lines long.
   * Make links descriptive. (e.g Don’t use ‘**Click here**’ or ‘**More info**’, rather ‘Download our **annual report**’)
   * Always check any new pages you’ve made on a mobile device - if you’re on a desktop computer, squash-up your browser window to show the mobile view.
   * Avoid copy-and-pasting directly from Word. Word files can include invisible styling code that can affect the presentation of the site’s content. Open text files in plain-text applications such as Notepad or TextEdit, and copy-and-paste from there.
   * Dates should be formatted: Fri 7 Feb 2014. Do not repeat values if you’re showing a date range e.g. Fri 7 - Thu 13 Feb 2014 (no need to repeat the month or year in this example).

##Files


   * Images must follow minimum size guidelines. Ideally images shouldn’t be more than 5mb when uploading. If possible use the ‘Save for web’ setting in Photoshop.
   * Crop images before uploading. Whilst the site will auto-crop it’s far better for an actual human person to decide how images should look, to avoid weird cropping!
   * If artists demand that images are show in full, ensure an un-cropped version is shown on the entry page. NEVER add white borders to the top, bottom, left or right of images!
   * Filenames should be brief, unique, lowercase and not contain spaces or strange characters such as (!@£$%^&*+_). Keep it to alpha-numerical, please.
   * If time permits, maybe even give the file a proper-and-correct title once you’ve uploaded it (with spaces and uppercase).
   * Images must have copyright approval before adding to the site. Add copyright information (including copyright year) in the credit and year fields as part of the file in the site’s file manager, ensuring these get referenced every time the image is used.
   * Unless absolutely necessary, avoid providing Word files or Spreadsheets as downloads. They dilute the brand and are open to presentational issues. Convert files to PDF before uploading.

##Tone of voice


   * Use active rather than passive language when describing a process (‘we are delivering an exciting project’, rather than ‘an exciting project is being delivered by us.’ )
   * Where possible address the user as ‘You’. e.g. ‘You can contact us here’ or ‘Book your seat here’
   * Avoid duplication; make use of links to avoid saying the same thing twice. Search engines don’t like duplicated content.
   * Be …
      * Specific
      * Informative
      * Clear and concise
   * You should …
      * Use friendly language, but not let this get in the way of information the user may be looking for.
      * Use contractions (e.g. can’t, won’t, doesn’t).
      * Not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar – e.g. say ‘You can’ rather than ‘You may be able to’.
      * Try to use the same language people might be searching for.
      * Always try to avoid using overly lengthly sentences that ramble on and on and then feature confusing sub-clauses, unless, however, you’re trying perhaps to maybe, possibly, make a point in an ironic fashion.
      * Avoid irony. It’s almost always lost in copy.
      * Make text gender neutral.

##Design Practises

   * Use larger text to start, with an introductory paragraph.
   * Use images, pull-out quotes, highlight boxes and paragraph breaks to break-up large blocks of text. This makes information much easier for people to take-in.
   * Ensure every page has an image or video of some kind. People like visual things!
   * Avoid making large amounts of body text ‘full width’ - it becomes very difficult to read.
   * Only use full-width slideshows when appropriate. Not all images can take being cropped tightly. (Instead, consider using a regular image gallery).
   * For new sections on a long page, don’t be afraid to use *separators* and titles to help divide things up a bit - users will love you a bit more if you do.

##Accessibility Practises

   * When making links, always include a descriptive alt-tag. (And never make a link which says "Click here" – this is an acessibility no-no.)
   * Avoid referring to another page element by location e.g. "Click the link on the right", as the link may be positioned elsewhere on different devices).
   * Avoid referring to colours. "The red box on the about page”. Visually impaired and/or colour-blind users will hate you forever.
   * Describe rich media. Videos and images might not be traditionally viewable by all users, but they can still be useful. Make captions meaningful and descriptive.
   * Add a ‘Title’ attribute to any links you add within text. (Google likes this too.)

##Search Engine Optimisation Practices

   * Consider adding extra ‘meta-tags’ to your most important pages. These enable the page to be better-referenced by search engines. Use the ‘Page title’ to make more searchable pages too.
   * Remember that Google pays attention to titles, bold words and links to see what’s most important on your page. Make sure these elements provide an informative and truthful overview of your page’s content.
