# Free UK Genealogy
Free UK Genealogy provides free, online access to family history records. We work with a team of dedicated volunteers to create high quality transcriptions of public records from governmental sources, parish churches, and other trusted institutions. We believe that Open Data and Open Source are key to making and keeping public records accessible to all.  We work with others with the same concerns.

# We Need You!

Volunteers are essential to every part of the project. We welcome contributions to the software, documentation, and to the records themselves.

Getting involved with helping out is simple; have a go at something on our waffle boards with a ‘Good First Issue’ label. Visit our 'GFI' web page for more information.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details on ways to contribute.
