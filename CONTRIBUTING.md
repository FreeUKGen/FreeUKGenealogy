Ensure you let us know what idea or issue you might like to help develop, or indeed if you have a new idea you would like to discuss. We will update the ideas as often as possible, however it is always a good idea to check them out on Github too (see below for instructions).

## Our Code of Conduct

Free UK Genealogy, including its software development team, operates 
under a [code of 
conduct](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/files/Documents/Code-of-Conduct.pdf).

The short version is, _Be excellent to each other_.  (See the full version at 
https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/files/Documents/Code-of-Conduct.pdf)

## How We Develop Software

Free UK Genealogy development operates on a modified Agile methodology, 
working in two-week sprints.  Technical teams developing MyopicVicar and 
related tools meet via a Google Hangout videoconference every two on 
Wednesday at 1530 GMT/1030 EST (FreeCEN) or 1630 GMT/1130 EST (FreeREG).  
Participants in this meeting review the previous sprint's work, discuss 
blocked issues, and schedule work for the next sprint.  Attendance at 
these meetings is not mandatory, but an email update from developers 
unable to attend is appreciated.

All development is tracked in Github issues, and organized and 
prioritized using Waffle.io, which provides a kanban-style interface.
